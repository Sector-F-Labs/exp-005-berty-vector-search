# exp-005-berty-milvus
A comparison of a BERT/Milvus stack in both Rust and Go

## Goal

The goal of this experiment is to compare the difficulty of using a BERT/Milvus stack in both Rust and Go. While Rust is the preferred language to to compatibility with llama-rs and has other benifits, Go is the preferred language for Milvus and has more mature support for Milvus.

## Method

The method of this experiment is to create a simple application that uses BERT to encode a sentence and then store the vector in Milvus. The application will then search for the vector in Milvus and return the sentence. Difficulties will be noted and compared, and a conclusion will be drawn.
